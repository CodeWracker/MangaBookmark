# MangaBookmark-Chrome-Extension

A chrome extension to keep track of the chapters that I'm Reading

# Why am I creating this?

Only and exclusively because I am frustrated by being unable to remember the name and chapters of the manga that I left accumulating and then read

# How to get it?

You can use the chrome store link below, or, if yopu want faster updates, you can clone this git or get it from releases
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mangabookmark/hclahhnkdechgledjlbjnldiakecdedg?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon

Download the most reacent version at realeases and install it.

## Install from releases

- Unpackage the file
- Go to the extension manager tab at chrome an let the dev option active
- "load unpacked" the build folder and be happy

## Intall from cloning

- $ npm i
- $ npm run build
- Go to the extension manager tab at chrome an let the dev option active
- "load unpacked" the build folder and be happy

# How it works

It saves the information of your manga list at your google sync storage, so if you remove the extension you will lose everything that you saved.

## Print of the actual extension

       (I'll try to let it prettier in the future, feel free to suggest a new design ðŸ¥°)
