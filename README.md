# MangaBookmark-Chrome-Extension

A chrome extension to keep track of the chapters that I'm Reading

# Why am I creating this?

Only and exclusively because I am irritated by being unable to remember, shout out the name and chapters of the manga that I left accumulating and then read

# How to get it?

This will be published as a paid extension for chrome, BUT I like free things and I want you to use my extension as you please, so you can get it from this git.

NOTE THAT YOU WILL NEED NPM AND REACT TO DOWNLOAD THE DEPENDENCIES AND COMPILE IT!!!

- Clone or Dowload this project and run </br>
  \$ npm i</br>
  \$ npm run-script build
- Go to the extension manager tab at chrome an let the dev option active
- "load unpacked" the build folder and be happy

# How it works

It saves the information of your manga list at your google sync storage, so if you remove the extension you will lose everything that you saved.

## Print of the actual extension

       (I'll try to let it prettier in the future, feel free to suggest a new design ðŸ¥°)
