# MangaBookmark-Chrome-Extension

A chrome extension to keep track of the chapters that I'm Reading

# Why am I creating this?

Only and exclusively because I am irritated by being unable to remember, shout out the name and chapters of the manga that I left accumulating and then read

## How it works

It saves the information of your manga list at your google sync storage

## How to get it?

Since i have to pay R\$30,00 to publish it at google webstore, you can get it from this git.

- Dowload this project and run </br>
       \$ npm i</br>
       \$ npm run-script build
- Go to the extension manager tab at chrome an let the dev option active
- load the build folder and be happy
