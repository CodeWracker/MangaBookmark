# MangaBookmark-Chrome-Extension

A chrome extension to keep track of the chapters that I'm Reading

# Why am I creating this?

Only and exclusively because I am irritated by being unable to remember, shout out the name and chapters of the manga that I left accumulating and then read

# How to get it?

Since i have to pay R\$30,00 to publish it at google webstore, you can get it from this git.

- Dowload this project and run </br>
  \$ npm i</br>
  \$ npm run-script build
- Go to the extension manager tab at chrome an let the dev option active
- "load unpacked" the build folder and be happy

# How it works

It saves the information of your manga list at your google sync storage

## Print of the actual extension

       (I'll try to let it prettier in the future, feel free to suggest a new design ðŸ¥°)
