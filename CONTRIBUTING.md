# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this.

Here are some important things:

- The [ReadMe](https://github.com/CodeWracker/MangaBookmark-Chrome-Extension/blob/develop/README.md) will tell you evething you need to know about how the project works!
- Found a Bug? Open an Issue, if it doesn't already exist
- Gonna commit something? Make the message in english or in Portuguese, you can choose.

## Submitting changes

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER! Create a new branch with a clear name that identifies your changes and play with the code THERE.

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to MangaBook](https://github.com/CodeWracker/MangaBookmark-Chrome-Extension/new/) with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow the coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

- I indent using four spaces (one tab)
- Would be nice if you put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
- This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
Rodrigo Ferraz Souza
